<p>Yesterday I spent more than 1 hour trying to upgrade my git to the latest version. I had been stuck on two issues. Fist, <code>git log</code> and <code>git clone</code> hanged forever. And <code>git commit -S</code> complained no secret key found while I do have the key on my machine.</p>
<p>The second issue is easy to solve as the root cause is <code>git</code> uses the <code>gpg</code> program installed by git installation program which assumes gnupg home dir is ~/.gnupg. But in my case the gnupg home dir is not there because I installed gnupg by gpg4win. I simply ran <code>git config --global gpg.program gpg2</code> to force git to use the one installed by gpg4win, and the problem solved.</p>
<p>The first one really frustrated me. I tried to uninstall-restart-reinstall a few times but no luck. <strong>Which finally solved these problems</strong> is that when the latest time I reinstall, I chose <code>Git only from Git Bash</code> option, and added <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin\git.exe</code> to PATH manually after the installation.<br />
I cannot guarantee this approach also works for you because I didn’t control the variable. I used 32 bit git installation program in the latest installation but 64 bit one for all other installations. I cannot tell which part of the changes solved the problem, but it’s still worth to try if you are also stuck on the same issue.</p>
