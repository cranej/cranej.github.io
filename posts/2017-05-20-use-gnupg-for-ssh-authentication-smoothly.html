<div class="info">

</div>

<p>In GnuPG 2.0 and 2.1, we are able to use <code>gpg-agent</code> to fully replace <code>ssh-agent</code>. And since 2.1, use gpg keys for ssh authentication with gpg-agent becomes much easier than in previous versions. No need to convert/export gpg keys as ssh keys via third party tools anymore. For me, the biggest benefit is that in this way, I can manage my gpg and ssh keys the same way in gnupg keyring.</p>
<h2 id="replace-ssh-agent-with-gpg-agent">Replace <code>ssh-agent</code> with <code>gpg-agent</code></h2>
<h3 id="configure">Configure</h3>
<p>Firstly we need to tell <code>gpg-agent</code> to <strong>enable ssh support</strong> by adding the following lines to <code>~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>enable-ssh-support</code></pre>
<p>And optionally, to <strong>avoid typing passphrase every time</strong>, add the following lines also:</p>
<pre><code>default-cache-ttl-ssh 10800
max-cache-ttl-ssh 10800</code></pre>
<p>These two lines set both maximum and default ssh key cache time to 3 hours.</p>
<h3 id="start-gpg-agent-at-startup">Start <code>gpg-agent</code> at startup</h3>
<p>Although GnuPG programs are able to start <code>gpg-agent</code> on demand, we still have to ensure the agent is started when we logged into the system as ssh client has no way to know that it needs to start <code>gpg-agent</code> nor how to do it. My choice is to add the following lines into <code>.zshrc</code>, you can adjust the script and where to put it in based on your need:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co">#Gnupg</span>
<span class="bu">unset</span> <span class="va">SSH_AGENT_PID</span>
<span class="kw">if</span> ! <span class="ex">pgrep</span> -x -u <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="va">${USER}</span><span class="st">&quot;</span> gpg-agent <span class="op">&gt;</span>/dev/null <span class="op">2&gt;&amp;1</span><span class="kw">;</span> <span class="kw">then</span>
  <span class="ex">gpg-connect-agent</span> /bye <span class="op">&gt;</span>/dev/null <span class="op">2&gt;&amp;1</span>
<span class="kw">fi</span>

<span class="bu">export</span> <span class="va">SSH_AUTH_SOCK=</span>/run/user/<span class="va">$UID</span>/gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh

<span class="bu">export</span> <span class="va">GPG_TTY=$(</span><span class="ex">tty</span><span class="va">)</span>
<span class="ex">gpg-connect-agent</span> updatestartuptty /bye <span class="op">&gt;</span>/dev/null</code></pre></div>
<p><del>The <code>GPG_TTY</code> line has nothing to do with <code>gpg-agent</code> but is necessary if you want curses based Pinentry to work without problems.</del><br />
Edit 2017-06-25: last week my <code>gpg-agent</code> stopped working as a <code>ssh-agent</code> with error <code>sign_and_send_pubkey: signing failed: agent refused operation</code>. After some searches on the web, I found that setting <code>GPG_TTY</code> correctly and plus the <code>updatestartuptty</code> line is the rescue.</p>
<h3 id="make-sure-ssh-agent-does-not-start-automatically-any-more">Make sure <code>ssh-agent</code> does not start automatically any more</h3>
<p>If you are using a full featured desktop environment like Gnome or KDE, <code>ssh-agent</code> must already be configured to run automatically at system startup. You need to consult the documentations of Gnome or KDE to remove it from the auto-start list.</p>
<p>If you are using <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> with a minimalist window manager like <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3wm</a> as me, nothing needs to be done as this setup does not start many things at startup usually.</p>
<h2 id="create-an-authentication-purposed-gpg-key-and-use-it-for-ssh-authentication">Create an authentication purposed gpg key and use it for ssh authentication</h2>
<h3 id="create-a-gpg-key-with-the-sole-purpose">Create a gpg key with the sole purpose</h3>
<p>Assume you already have a gpg key, if not please create one via <code>gpg --gen-key</code> first. Now add a new key which has only one capability - authentication:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run <code>gpg --expert --edit-key [your key id here]</code></li>
<li>In the interactive shell run <code>addkey</code></li>
<li>Select <code>RSA (set your own capabilities)</code></li>
<li>Select <code>S</code> then <code>E</code> to turn off the default sign and encrypt capabilities, then select <code>A</code> to turn on authentication.</li>
<li>Select <code>Q</code> to finish capabilities selection and finish other steps.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="use-the-new-created-key-for-ssh-authentication">Use the new created key for ssh authentication</h3>
<p>Prior to gpg version 2.1, you will have to use some third party tools to convert the gpg key to ssh key, and use it in the same way as for other ordinary ssh keys. Start from version 2.1 things became much easier.</p>
<ol>
<li>Find out <em>keygrip</em> of the new created key by running <code>gpg2 --with-keygrip -k [your key id]</code>.</li>
<li>Write it into <code>~/.gnupg/sshcontrol</code> as a separate line.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now if you run <code>ssh-add -l</code> you should be able to see the new added key.</p>
<p>To export the public key in a correct form for <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> and github etc., use <code>ssh-add -L</code> instead.</p>
