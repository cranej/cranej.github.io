<p>With gpg email client plugin like GPGMail, you can easily send encrypted and signed email. Of course, plugin like GPGMail also decrypts and verifies email signature for you automatically. GPGMail use the <em>offical</em> standard way PGP/MIME (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3156">rfc3156</a>) to send OpenGPG encrypted and signed emails. What if you received encrypted/signed email in PGP/MIME format while your email client or gpg plugin does not support PGP/Mime? For signed emails, you cannot verify the signature but you can still see the content. For encrypted emails, you get two attachments. I will show you how to decrypt and verify them with only <code>gpg</code> command and a text editor.</p>
<h2 id="signed-email">Signed Email</h2>
<p>First you need to download the source of the signed email. In Apple Mail just click menu File -&gt; Save As to save the message as raw message source. In Outlook.com email web interface, right click the message on the email from the left column, and click <code>View message source</code>, and then manually copy the content to a text file.</p>
<p>Open the saved the message source file in any text editor, search for “multipart/signed” and delete any lines before this line as we don’t need these headers. Then we got something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>1 Content-Type: multipart/signed;
2 	boundary=&quot;Apple-Mail=_7A110488-625C-4A1B-84AC-2F9F6F5BC49F&quot;;

<p>The email message consists of two parts: line 14 ~ 18 is what has been signed (note do not include the tail blank line), line 26 ~ 41 is the signature. Save these two parts as separate files, for example, <code>message.txt</code> and <code>signature.asc</code>. Now you may already know how to do the rest:</p>
<pre><code>gpg --verify signature.asc message.txt</code></pre>
<h2 id="encrypted-and-signed-email">Encrypted and Signed Email</h2>
<p>For this one, we use a more complicated example. Say the email you received has an attachment and a body, and the email was signed by sender and then encrypted to you. As I mentioned at the beginning, for this case you will see the email message as two attachments and no content in the body. If the email was sent by GPGMail, the two attachments will be named as “Mail Attachment” and “encrypted.asc” which you can clearly know “encrypted.asc” is what we need. Actually, “Mail Attachment” is just a plain text<br />
file which contains only one line “Version 1”. If you received a message that was not sent by GPGMail and did not follow the name convention, you can determine which attachment should be used by examine the contents of them.</p>
<p>If you open “encrypted.asc” with a text editor, you will see that it’s just a armored gpg encrypted message which begins with “—-BEGIN PGP MESSAGE—-” and ends with “—-END PGP MESSAGE—-”. First, we need to decrypt it:</p>
<pre><code>gpg -o decrypted -d encrypted.asc</code></pre>
<p>Open decrypted in text editor, we got something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>1 Content-Type: multipart/signed;

<p>It’s similar as the example we used in previous section <strong>Signed Email</strong>. The boundary string used to separate the signed data and the signature is “Apple-Mail=_61F7F512-9AAD-4F60-9462-F35CCAC90ED1” in line 2, it also appears on line 7, line 33, and line 58. Thus, the email can be split as two parts: line 8 to 31 (tail blank line removed) is the data which was signed, line 41 to 6 is the signature itself. To verify the signature, save them as separate files and use the same command as in previous section.</p>
<p>The last thing is how to extract the attachment, in this example, “pbencrypt.sh”. The first part (line 8 to 31) itself consists of two parts which were separated with boundary string “Apple-Mail=_91F869CE-76D7-415D-B847-2CAC206A4328” which can be found at line 9. Use this boundary string, we can split line 8 to 31 as two parts: line 15 to 21 is the attachment, line 24 to 30 is the message body. If the attachment file is not a text file, it will be encoded as base64, just copy the encoded string as use some utility tools like <code>base64</code> to convert it back to binary file.</p>
